abstract={The basic motivation of this work to propose a new wireless network architecture for Healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) system. The quantity of devices in IoT is increasing rapidly as it provides remote connectivity and data accessibility. As per the Statista, the connected things in IoT will be about 75 billion by the year 2025. This sudden rise in data generation in IoT will lead to drop in wireless network quality by aggravating delay, erroneous data, and loss of data. In case of healthcare IoT applications the prompt and accurate information is utmost important. The conceptual model of distributive wireless network architecture is proposed with the goal of improving quality of service offered by the IoT in hospitals. The proposed model can work as a system capable of clinical decision and support by offering timely, correct disease diagnosis and suggesting the effective treatment as well. Majorly, the final module developed can bring down the quantity of work of doctors and also improve the rate at which patients get cured.},

ABSTRACT = {IoT technology is used in various industries, including the manufacturing, energy, finance, education, transportation, smart home, and medical fields. In the medical field, IoT applications can provide high-quality medical services through the efficient management of patients and mobile assets in hospitals. In this paper, we introduce an IoT system to the medical field using Sigfox, a low-power communication network for indoor location monitoring used as a hospital network. A proof-of-concept (PoC) was implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of medical device and patient safety management. Specific requirements should be considered when applying the IoMT system in a hospital environment. In this study, the location and temperature of various targets sending signals to the monitoring system using three different networks (Sigfox, Hospital and Non-Hospital) were collected and compared with true data, the average accuracy of which were 69.2%, 72.5%, and 83.3%, respectively. This paper shows the significance in the application of an IoMT using the Sigfox network in a hospital setting in Korea compared with existing hospital networks.},

abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a transformative concept in healthcare, leveraging the power of connected devices and technology to improve patient care and health outcomes. These devices are typically connected to the internet or a network and can communicate with each other to exchange data and provide insights to healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders. Advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Blockchain integrated into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can better mitigate the impact of pandemics and protect public health. IoMT utilizes medical sensors to capture real-time physiological data of patients and is available to a medical professional to diagnose, recognize, analyze, and make appropriate decisions. Data breaches or cyberattacks could compromise the security and integrity of IoMT devices and data, exposing sensitive information or causing malfunctions or disruptions. Consequently, to make IoMT systems reliable, data protection and secure communication must conform to security standards. Blockchain technology is being used in the healthcare industry to ensure the security of patient records and to streamline the sharing of information among healthcare providers, laboratories, pharmaceutical firms, and other healthcare providers. Overall, digital technologies have been instrumental in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling more efficient surveillance, response, and care delivery. By leveraging these technologies, public health authorities and healthcare providers have been able to better mitigate the impact of the pandemic and protect public health.},
